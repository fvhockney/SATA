  <h1>Language</h1>
  <p>
    Israel has two official languages: Hebrew and Arabic. Virtually all street and official signs are written in Hebrew, Arabic, and, though not an official language, English. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/mapped-english-speaking-countries/">Israel has one of the largest English-speaking populations in the world at about *85%.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Hebrew is an ancient and unique language. Having survived centuries of history, where it was only read from the bible and used during Jewish prayer, it was revived as a modern language over 150 years ago by Eliezer Ben Yehuda. Today, Hebrew is spoken predominantly in Israel, with the second most fluent speakers located in the United States (220,000).
