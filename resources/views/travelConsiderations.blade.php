  <h3>Passports and Visas</h3>
  <p>
    You will need a signed valid passport to travel to Israel. Consult your local Passport office if you have any questions about the validity of your passport, if you must renew your current one or if you need obtain one for the first time. Please be sure that your passport will not expire within 6 months after your scheduled departure from Israel. Otherwise it is considered invalid and must be renewed immediately. Anyone traveling to other countries before or after the mission should check with the appropriate Consulates directly regarding visa requirements, applications and process. If you have a passport from another country, consult your Embassy or Consulate regarding visa requirements for Israel and any other country you may be visiting on this trip.

  <h4>Important Notice:</h4>
  <p>
    <span class="lead">Upon entering Israel, please be sure to retain the stamped, separate slip that is issued at Israeli Passport Control.</span> As passports are no longer manually stamped, this is your official entry into the country and serves as ID while traveling within Israel. It is also required at hotel check-in.

  </p>

  <h3>Phones and Power</h3>
  <p>
    You can call your cell phone provider to see what international plans/packages they offer, or purchase or rent a pre-paid Israeli SIM card or cell phone from an external provider such as <a href="www.gcellular.net">Global Cellular/IsraelPhones</a> or <a href="www.travelcell.com">TravelCell</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Israel’s electric current standard is the European 220/240 V/50Hz. These can easily be ordered online and are sometimes available at your local general store. If you’re unsure of what to look for, simply type the words “Israel Adapter” into Google search.

  <h2>At the Airport</h2>
  <h3>Luggage</h3>
  <p>
    Baggage Allowance: Please check with your airline carrier’s policy regarding luggage allowance (weight and numbers of bags) regulations.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are traveling through Europe to Israel, you may be subject to weight regulations. Inter-European air travel (for example, Tel Aviv/London) restricts you to 44 pounds total baggage weight.
  </p>

  <h3>Customs</h3>
  <p>
    Unless you plan to bring valuable items into the country as gifts (worth several thousand dollars), Israeli Customs are generally quick and easy.
  </p>

  <h3>Communication and Technology</h3>
  <p>
    In this age of instant information and communication, visitors to Israel are pleased to find they are never out of touch. Not only does Israel enjoy a broad communications infrastructure, but it is one of the world-leaders in developing new communications technology. Most hotels offer upwards of 40 cable television stations, including the world’s major news organizations and a variety of local, regional and European channels. Internet access and satellite-broadcast systems for teleconferencing are readily available. The reception staff at your hotel should be able to arrange these in advance of your stay.
